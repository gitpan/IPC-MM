DESCRIPTION

  IPC::MM provides an interface to Ralf Engelschall's mm library, allowing
  data to be shared between multiple processes in a relatively convenient
  way.

  modify it under the same terms as Perl itself.

  THIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRENTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER

PREREQUISITES

  This module requires Ralf Engelschall's mm library.
  I have tested it with version 1.0.9.
  http://www.engelschall.com/sw/mm/

  This module requires perl 5.004 or later.

INSTALLATION

  Before installing this module, you must first install the mm library.
  Please refer to the instructions therein for details.

  To install this module, move into the directory where this file is
  located and type the following:

       perl Makefile.PL
       make
       make test        (optional)
       make install

  This will install the module into the Perl library directory.

  See the POD documentation for further details. Once the module
  is installed, you should be able to read the documentation by
  typing the following from the command-line:

       perldoc IPC::MM

EXAMPLE

  The example/ directory contains a few files to serve as a demonstration and
  example of IPC::MM.

  mm_server.pl is a forking server that maintains a shared hash. It accepts
  connections from clients and forks, so that a child process is making the
  changes to the shared hash.

  mm_client.pl is the client for mm_server.pl. It sends a command to the
  server over a specified socket, and prints the results.

  load.sh is a convenience shell script that calls mm_client.pl a bunch o'
  times in order to populate the shared hash maintained by mm_server.pl

NOTES

  This module has not been extensively tested, so it should be considered
  alpha software at best.

  This is probably the first and only release of this module that I will
  make. Anybody is welcome to make improvements to this module and to
  take ownership of it as well.
